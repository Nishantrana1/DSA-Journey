Day 1


what is recursion>
well in simple word when a fucntion call itsself directly or indirectly to perform task same as loop 

to calculate the time complexity of recursion we need to do is 
There are two ways

1. Recurrence Relation
2. TC= total number of recursion call * Work done in every call.

For the space complexity There are always two methods

1. SC= depth of the Rec tree * mem in each cell
2. SC= hight of the call stack * memory in each cell.
